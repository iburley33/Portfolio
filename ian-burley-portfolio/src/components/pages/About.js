      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Ian Burley and I’m a husband and father of two. I’m interested in tech, fitness, hiking, gaming and honestly anything fun as long as my kids can come. My family and I are always looking for the next new experience and I’m always in a hurry to show the beauty of the world to my daughters. My family, including my big ol’ golden-doodle Jake, have blessed me with a perfect life and thanks to their support, I’m very excited to be on my new path to a career in tech.

        As a young professional, I spent my twenties in the fitness industry opening up gyms across the country and trying to channel my strong intuition for business and satiate my hunger to teach and help others improve their lives. I had the opportunity to travel the country at a young age in a leadership position. As a regional manager, I was directly responsible for multiple health club locations across the east coast, all the way from Virginia to Rhode Island and I spent every other week traveling. I spent a large amount of time working in airports and planes but ultimately, I knew that this kind of travel, while fun at the time, was not sustainable long term, because it was keeping me from my wife, Kylee and my two beautiful daughters, Kennedy and Violet. I knew I needed to find a path that would allow me to fulfill my duties as a provider but also allow me to be a constant presence in their lives.

      For this reason, I started to look for new career paths and eventually decided that a career in tech was my path due to my love for computers and all things electronic. Originally my love for electronics was realized from the hardware side of things. I loved building PCs and was always the guy my friends could call to help when deciding on new computer parts and with installation. By 2020 I was very interested in starting my coding journey as I was known as the local IT guy and was I was told that I may have a knack for it due to my fluency with excel and some of the large excel projects I created for my company at the time.

      Enter Covid-19, the entire world got flipped on it’s head and my world was no exception. The fitness industry took a huge blow from the forced closures and from an internal operations perspective, changed forever. My company in particular was simply not prepared and ultimately ended up filing for bankruptcy like many other fitness companies. Our entire corporate leadership from the CEO down jumped ship. These were people I had been working with for over a decade to build this company, and suddenly I was left with an important decision to make. I decided that it was time to follow my passion and put in the work to start the difficult journey to reposition myself in the industry I truly wanted to be in. Software!

      I started with self learning and used resources like YouTube and Treehouse to learn the basics just to be sure that it was something that would actually resonate with me. To my pleasant surprise, it not only resonated with me but I was having a blast! I had found my newest hobby and I was fascinated by it. It was at this time that I decided to enroll in UC Davis to get a more formal education and give me the resources I needed to turn my hobby into a career. At this point, I’ve had the opportunity to work with many other new coders on multiple projects and I have found a mentor that is dedicated to helping me to not only build a career but to one day be an industry leader, just as I was in my previous path.
